DVRescue is cross-platform archivist made and designed software for the advanced support of data migration from DV tapes into digital files suitable for long-term preservtaion. It facilitates both high-quality digital capture via FireWire as well as provides deep levels of context and analysis of embedded DV metadata that can be used, among other things, to create files with highly reduced error rate via amalgamating across multiple captures.

Its [project development](https://github.com/mipops/dvrescue) page can be found on Github and it can be downloaded for various systems from the [MediaArea DVRescue](https://mediaarea.net/DVRescue) page.
