# Project Overview

## Project

In 2018, Moving Image Preservation of Puget Sound ([MIPoPS](https://www.mipops.org)) and [RiceCapades](http://dericed.com/) received a Research & Development grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities to fund their collaborative project DVRescue!

This project is dedicated to developing procedures and tools that will support migrating data from DV tapes into digital files suitable for long-term preservation. This has filled an urgent need for DV tape transfer tools that can rescue content from at-risk digital videotape formats. The DVRescue project works to develop open source and freely available software, conduct user research and testing, and create documentation to help define and perform comprehensive, automated, and easy-to-use data migration techniques. 

Work is ongoing and can be followed on the [Development Updates page](https://mipops.github.io/dvrescue/sections/project_overview.html), the project's [development repository](https://github.com/mipops/dvrescue) and the [MIPoPS blog](https://mipops.tumblr.com/).
