# Introduction

## Project

Moving Image Preservation of Puget Sound ([MIPoPS](https://www.mipops.org)) and [RiceCapades](http://dericed.com/) are thrilled to announce that they are the recent recipients of a Research & Development grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities to fund their collaborative project DV Rescue!

This project will develop procedures and tools that will support migrating data from DV tapes into digital files suitable for long-term preservation. This will fill an urgent need for DV tape transfer tools that can rescue content from at-risk digital videotape formats. The DV Rescue project will entail two years of work to develop open source and freely available software, conduct user research and testing, and create documentation to help define and perform comprehensive, automated, and easy-to-use data migration techniques.

Work is ongoing and can be followed at this page, the project's [development repository](https://github.com/mipops/dvrescue) and the [MIPoPS blog](https://mipops.tumblr.com/).
